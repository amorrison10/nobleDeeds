                        Anacaona (1474-1503) was a Taíno chief, born in what is now Léogâne,
                            Haiti, into a family of chiefs. Her brother and her husband were two of
                            the five highest chiefs who ruled the island of

                             when the Spaniards colonized it in 1492. She was celebrated as
                            a composed of ballards and narrative poems, called areítos.

                 "Ask the gray pilgrim by the surges cast On hostile shores, and numbed
                    beneath the blast, Ask who revived him? who the hearth began To kindle? who with
                    spilling goblet ran? Oh! he will dart one spark of youthful flame, And clasp his
                    withered hands, and Woman name.” BARRETT.
                
                Hospitality has ever been a distinguishing
                    characteristic of Woman; compassion not only graces the educated and polished
                    European lady, but is equally inherent in the bosom of the wild unlettered
                    savage, and their distressed fellow-creatures find a ready home and shelter with
                    both: thus the shipwrecked mariner and the wayworn traveller surviving their
                    perils, return to their native country to unite theirs to the many testimonies
                    already received of the charity and hospitality of the female sex.
                
                40 HOSPITALITY.
                "Haste, gentle lady, haste—there waits A noble stranger at the gates."
                        Sir Walter Scott
                
                Washington Irving, in his
                    Life of Columbus, gives an interesting account of Anacaona, widow of Caonabo,
                    who, after the capture of her husband by the Spaniards, had taken refuge with
                    her brother, the Cacique Behechio, who governed the province of Xaragua.
                On the death of Behechio, Anacaona succeeded to the government. Her magnanimous
                    spirit was evinced in her amicable treatment of the Spaniards, towards whom,
                    notwithstanding the ruin in which they had involved her husband, who died their
                    prisoner, she appears to have entertained no vindictive feeling.
                Notwithstanding the friendly behaviour of Anacaona, Ovando, the Spanish general,
                    imagined that there was a deep-laid conspiracy, among the Indians of Xaragua, to
                    rise upon the Spaniards; and he "set out for that prodvince, at the head of
                    three hundred foot soldiers, armed with swords, arquebuses, and crossbows, and
                    seventy horsemen, with cuirasses, bucklers, and lances. He pretended that he was
                    going on a mere visit to Anacaona, and to make an arrangement about the payment
                    of tribute.
                "When Anacaona heard of this intended visit, she sent to all her tributary
                    caciques, and to all her principal subjects, to assemble at her chief town, that
                    they might receive the commander of the Spaniards with becoming ho- 
                    HOSPITALITY. 41 mage and distinction. As Ovando, at the head of his
                    little army, approached, she went forth to meet him, according to the custom of
                    her nation, attended by a great train of her most distinguished subjects, male
                    and female. They received the Spaniards with the popular areytos, their national
                    songs; the young women waving palm branches, and dancing before them.

                "Anacaona treated the governor with that natural graciousness and dignity for
                    which she was celebrated. She gave him the largest house in the place for his
                    residence, and his people were quartered in the houses adjoining. For several
                    days the Spaniards were entertained with all the natural luxuries that the
                    province afforded. National songs and dances, and games, were performed for
                    their amusement, and there was every outward demonstration of the same
                    hospitality, the same amity, that Anacaona had uniformly shown to white men.

                "Notwithstanding all this kindness, Ovando being persuaded that Anacaona secretly
                    meditated a massacre of himself and his followers, resolved to anticipate the
                    supposed plot by a counter-artifice, and to overwhelm this defenceless people in
                    an indiscriminate and bloody vengeance.
                "He accordingly invited the Indians, in return, to witness certain national games
                    of his country; and amongst other diversions was to be a tilting match, or joust
                    with reeds, and all the Spaniards were secretly instructed to arm themselves
                    with weapons of a more deadly VOL. II. E
                    
                    42 HOSPITALITY. character, and to be in readiness for the signal of
                    their commander.
                Anacaona, with her daughter, attendants, and all the caciques, were assembled in
                    a house which commanded a view of the square in which the joust was to take
                    place. "Ovando, perceiving that every thing was disposed according to his
                    orders, gave the fatal signal. The house was surrounded and no one permitted to
                    escape. The Spaniards entered, and seizing upon the caciques, bound them to the
                    posts which supported the roof. Anacaona was led forth a prisoner. The unhappy
                    caciques were then put to horrible tortures, until some of them, in the
                    extremity of anguish, were made to accuse the queen and themselves of the plot
                    with which they were charged. When this cruel mockery of judicial form had been
                    executed, instead of preserving them for after-examination, fire was set to the
                    house, and all the caciques perished miserably in the flames." 

                Mean while a most horrid massacre took place without; the armed horseman,
                    sparing neither age nor sex, put the defenceless throng to an indiscriminate
                    slaughter, and the princess Anacaona was carried in chains to San Domingo. "The
                    mockery of a trial," continues the historian, "was given her, in which she was
                    found guilty, on the confessions which had been wrung by tortures, from her
                    subjects, and on the testimony of their butchers; and she was ignominiously
                    hanged, and in the presence of

                    befriended."
                "This ancient fortress of my race Shall be misfortune’s resting-place,
                    Shelter and shield of the distress’d, No slaughter-house for shipwreck’d guest."
                "Renata, Duchess of Ferrara, daughter of Louis the
                    Twelfth, and of Anne of Bretagne, after her conversion to the Protestant faith,
                    and her retirement to the castle of Montargis, was distinguished by her
                    hospitality and goodness. She displayed her kindness more particularly towards
                    her countrymen: every Frenchman, who in travelling through Ferrara was exposed
                    to want or sickness, experienced her benevolence and liberality. After the
                    return of the Duke of Guise from Italy, she saved, as the army passed through
                    Ferrara, more than ten thousand of the French from
                    perishing by want and hardships. Her steward representing to her the enormous
                    sums which her bounty thus expended, 'What,' replied she, 'would you have me do?
                    These are my countrymen, who would have been my subjects but for the Salic law.'
                    During the civil wars in France, she retired into her city and castle of
                    Montargis, where she received and supported numbers of distressed persons, who
                    had been driven from their homes and estates."

                "I myself," says Brantome, "during the second period of these troubles, when the
                    force

                    by Messrs. De Ferrides and De Mousales, were marching towards the king, and
                    passing by Montargis, stopped as in duty bound to pay my respects to her. I
                    myself saw, in her castle, above three hundred protestants, who had fled thither
                    from all parts of the country. An old steward whom I had known at Ferrara and in
                    France, protested to me that she fed daily more than three hundred people, who
                    had taken refuge with her."
                
                "If a hope of safety rest, 'Tis on the sacred name of guest."
                Hospitality has been too often dangerous to those by
                    whom it has been exercised: during the proscriptions of Marius and Sylla, it was
                    considered a crime against the state to afford shelter to the outlawed
                    fugitives, and punished by the extreme penalty of the law. Yet, in those as well
                    as later times, women have been found who, with a courage superior to all
                    hazard, have dared to acquit themselves of this first duty to society, and who
                    have chosen to peril their lives and fortunes, rather than violate its sacred
                    ties. It is a painful reflection that such self-devoted and heroic beings should
                    have sometimes experienced the basest ingratitude from the objects of their
                    bounty; yet it was by no means an infrequent occurrence for those, whose disin-
                        
                     HOSPITALITY. 45 terested compassion had generously bestowed shelter
                    and support to the houseless wanderer, to be, in return for such favours,
                    denounced as traitors, for the sake of the paltry reward offered for their
                    apprehension.

                An example of this occurred in the reign of James the Second. "During Monmouth's
                    rebellion, one of his followers, knowing the humane disposition of a lady of the
                    name of Gaunt, whose life was one continued exercise of beneficence, fled to her
                    house, where he was concealed and maintained for some time. Hearing, however, of
                    the proclamation which promised an indemnity and reward to those who discovered
                    such as harboured the rebels, he betrayed his benefactress; and such was the
                    spirit of justice and equity which prevailed among the ministers, that the
                    ungrateful wretch was pardoned, and recompensed for his treachery, while his
                    benefactress was burnt alive for her charity towards
                    him."
                
                "Take with free welcome what our hands prepare, Such food as falls to simple
                    servants' share." Pope's Homer.

                "After the battle of Culloden, so fatal to the last
                    hopes of the House of Stuart, Colonel Stuart, attended by his friend, Mr.
                    Hamilton of Balgour, sought his personal safety in flight. They approached a
                    lonely hut in the Highlands, to which Mr. Hamilton went to ask
                E*

                shelter for an unfortunate stranger. The good woman opened her wattled door, and
                    his looks comprehended at once that a poor refugee was in distress: though she
                    did not understand one word of English, she followed Mr. Hamilton to the spot
                    where he had left Colonel Stuart, who addressed her in her native tongue, and as
                    his case was desperate, confided to her their names and their peril. She told
                    him the cattle were pasturing near her cottage; but if he would wait a little,
                    she would send the herds out of view, and get him removed without exciting
                    suspicion. Having succeeded in this, she kept them concealed for several days;
                    and when they at length quitted their humane preserver, she loaded them with
                    provisions, accompanied them for several miles, pointing out the unfrequented
                    paths, or where they might venture to ask for a lodging, refusing at the same
                    time the slightest remuneration. What adds to the merit of the action, is that
                    the poor widow had lost two sons in the king’s cause, to which she was strongly
                    attached."
                
                "O, Woman! When pain and anguish wring the brow, A ministering angel thou!"
                        Sir Walter Scott.
                

                The honourable and hospitable conduct of the
                    Highlanders was well illustrated, at the 
                    HOSPITALITY, 47 same period, by the conduct of a clergyman and his
                    wife, of the name of Gordon.

                "After the battle of Culloden, immense numbers of officers and men received
                    refreshments from Mrs. Gordon, and every part of the manse, except one room, was
                    filled with the wounded. To guard against treachery, Mrs. Gordon lodged the
                    fugitives in separate apartments. So cautiously did she conceal from each, the
                    condition of the others, that the first request was, that they would not intrust
                    her with their real names: she could serve them under a fictitious appellation.
                    In this manner a father and son were five months under her roof, without knowing
                    their proximity. Colonel Stuart, being a native of the neighbouring country, was
                    personally known, and, with his usual impetuosity, had introduced his friend Mr.
                    Hamilton, before Mrs. Gordon could ask him to give only a borrowed name.
                    However, she said, the gentleman must in future assume the designation of Mr.
                    Milton, and the colonel himself must be Mr. Grey. She gave separate chambers to
                    each, and as Colonel Stuart was the most obnoxious to government, the window of
                    his room allowed a speedy retreat to the lake, where a boat was constantly in
                    waiting, to facilitate his escape to the upper district of Badenoch, in case of
                    a close pursuit by the military stationed all around, to intercept the outlaws.
                    In a few days Colonel Stuart found he must betake himself to his friends in the
                    mountains; but the inquest in that quarter be- 
                    48 HOSPITALITY. ing more rigid, he returned to Alvey, and hearing music
                    and dancing, he got in at the window of his own room and went to bed. He had
                    been two days and three nights without rest, sometimes hidden in caverns,
                    sometimes even obliged to strip and plunge into a bog, covering his head with
                    branches of birch, which he carried for the express purpose; and sometimes, like
                    Charles the Second, he eluded his pursuers by ascending a tree. He was now
                    disposed to sleep soundly, little suspecting that several officers were in the
                    house. Mrs. Gordon had heard they were in search of Colonel Stuart. She hoped he

                    collecting some young people, and appearing heedlessly merry, she knew would
                    divert suspicion. The officers, in place of ransacking the manse, joined the
                    merry dancers, and went away after supper, convinced that a family so jovial
                    could have no concealments. Some of the company were to sleep at the manse. Mrs.
                    Gordon had then no spare room, except that occupied by her daughter; but she
                    made as many beds as the floor could contain, and the young lady with her cousin
                    were removed to Mr. Grey’s room. They undressed. One of them attempted to raise
                    the bedclothes, when Colonel Stuart awoke. He had loaded pistols, and his sword
                    unsheathed always beside him when he lay down to rest. Providentially the sword
                    came first to hand. The candle had been extinguished, but a gleam of the moon

                    Colonel Stuart seized the pistol, it must have been too late to recognize the
                    daughter of his benefactress. The shock of a bare possibility of taking her
                    life, he said, was more overwhelming than all his past misfortunes. She was Mrs.
                    Gordon’s only child."

                Colonel Stuart pays the following tribute to the female sex: "In all our
                    wanderings," says he, "we have preferred applying to the gentler sex. They never
                    rejected us; and, if they could contribute to providing for our safety, after
                    separating from them, we found they had a quick and clear perception of the
                    means, and sympathy to stimulate their exertions, and to render them effectual.
                    Even ladies, who were keen partisans of the House of Hanover, spared neither
                    trouble nor expense in our behalf."
                
                "'Tis ours this son of sorrow to relieve, Cheer the sad heart, not let

                The celebrated traveler, Mr. Mungo Park, experienced
                    the hospitality of the female-sex on many occasions. “In his first African
                    journey he had arrived at Sego, the capital of the kingdom of Bambarra, and
                    sought to obtain a passage across the river to that part of the town in which
                    the king resided; but owing 
                    50 HOSPITALITY. to the crowd of passengers, he was detained two hours;
                    during which time his majesty was apprized that a white man, poorly equipped was
                    about to pass the river, to seek an audience. A chief was immediately sent, with
                    an express order that the traveler should not cross without his majesty’s
                    permission, and pointed to a village at some distance, where it was recommended
                    that the stranger should pass the night. Park, not a little disconcerted,
                    repaired to the village; but as the order had not been accompanied with any
                    provision for his reception, he found every door shut. Turning his horse loose
                    to graze, he was preparing, as a security from wild beasts, to climb a tree and
                    sleep among the branches, when a beautiful and affecting incident occurred,
                    which gives a most pleasing view of the negro character. An old woman returning
                    from the labours of the field, cast on him a look of compassion, and desired him
                    to follow her. She led him to an apartment in her hut, procured a fine fish,
                    which she broiled for his supper, and spread a mat for him to sleep upon. She
                    then desired her maidens, who had been gazing in fixed astonishment at the white
                    man, to resume their tasks, which they continued to ply through a great part of
                    the night. They cheered their labours with a song, which must have been composed
                        ex tempore, since Mr. Park, with deep emotion,
                    discovered that he himself was the subject of it. It said, in a strain of
                    affecting simplicity,—‘The winds roared, and the rains fell. The

                    &amp;c.’ Our traveler was much affected, and the next morning could not depart
                    without requesting his landlady’s acceptance of the only gift he had left, two
                    out of the four brass buttons that still remained on his waistcoat."

                "When, at the period of the French Revolution, the
                    chiefs of Gironde party were fugitives in the south of France, and every where
                    sought that asylum which was too often denied them by self-love and cowardice,
                    Gaudet found a place of succour and safety in the house of one of his female
                    relatives, whose name was Bouquet, not only for himself, but also for his friend
                    Salles. The news of this unexpected relief being carried to three companies of
                    the proscribed Deputies, they determined to beg this courageous woman to permit
                    them to share in the retreat of their friends. A 
                    52 HOSPITALITY. faithful messenger was found, and returned in a few
                    hours with the answer. Madame Bouquet invited them to come; but, at the same
                    time, recommended them not to approach her house till midnight, and to take
                    every possible precaution not to be perceived by anyone; their safety in her
                    house, which was what occupied her thoughts, depended greatly on these
                    preliminary conditions.

                "They arrived at midnight. They found their friends lodged thirty feet under
                    ground, in a large vault, the entrance to which was so concealed that it was
                    impossible for a person ignorant of the circumstance to perceive it.

                "The continual residence of five men in this cellar, although it was very
                    spacious, rendered the air so corrupt that, as it could not be renewed but with
                    great difficulty, Madame Bouquet contrived, in another part of the house, a
                    second asylum, more healthy, and almost as secure. A few days afterwards, Buzot
                    and Petion informed them by letter, that having within fifteen days changed
                    their place of retreat seven times, they were now reduced to the greatest
                    distress. 'Let them both come,' exclaimed this generous woman.

                "All this time not a day passed without Madame Bouquet being menaced with a
                    domiciliary visit, not a day in which the guillotine did not lay some heads in
                    the dust. Too generous not to be liable to suspicion, this heroic woman each day
                    heard the satellites of tyrrany swear, as they passed her habitation, that they
                    would burn alive in their houses all

                "'Well,' said she, 'let these inquisitors come. I am contented, provided you do
                    not take upon yourselves to receive them; all that fear is, that they will
                    arrest me, and then—what will become of you?'

                "Petion and Buzot arrived, and then there were seven of them. The difficulty to
                    provide for them was great, provisions being extremely scarce in the department.
                    Madame Bouquet’s house was allowed by the municipality only one pound of bread
                    per day; but, fortunately, she had a stock of potatoes and dried kidney-beans.
                    To save breakfast, it was agreed that her guests should not rise till noon.
                    Vegetable soup was their whole dinner. After the day had closed, the Deputies
                    silently and cautiously left their retreat, and assembled round their
                    benefactress. She was in the midst of them as a mother among her children, for
                    whom she devotes her life. Sometimes a morsel of beef, procured with great
                    difficulty, an egg or two, some vegetables, and a little milk, formed the
                    supper, of which the hostess ate but little, however entreated, the better to
                    support her guests.
                "A month stole away in this peaceful security, with which was mingled the sweet
                    enjoyment of generous affection and grateful friendship; when the Deputies,
                    having some unusual reason to fear for the safety of their benefactress,
                    forcibly expressed to her their appre-  VOL. II. F

                    this admirable woman, ‘having given you shelter? And is not death all that is to
                    be desired, when one has done all the good possible?'

                "A circumstance which adds infinite value to this generosity was, that Madame
                    Bouquet carefully concealed from her guests the uneasiness which secretly
                    consumed her, occasioned by one of her relations, who had formerly been the
                    intimate friend of Guadet. This man having learned what passed in Madame
                    Bouquet’s house, set in action every means his mind could suggest, composed of
                    falsehoods and artifices, the fruits of a pusillanimous temper and a miserable
                    self-love, to induce her to banish the fugitives from her house. Every day he
                    came to her with stories more terrible one than another. Sometimes he declared
                    that he felt himself bound to denounce traitors put out of the sanction of the
                    law; and then he would affect strong remonstrances in behalf of a family
                    endangered by her imprudent conduct. He sometimes acted as if his mind was
                    disordered by the terrors that, on her account, he indulged in; and, at length,
                    fearing that he would take some sudden and desperate measure, endangering the
                    lives of the Deputies, she felt it justice to them, to lay her situation before
                    them. Her voice was almost stifled with grief as she spoke to them.
                "There was but one course for the Deputies to take; they resolved to quit their
                    happy and peaceful asylum, and the moment of their separation, so mournful to
                    all, and so fatal and

                    night.

                    instead of an altar reared to their glory, those whom it actuates are sent to
                    the scaffold!

                "Suspected of having afforded an asylum to the fugitive deputies, it was not long
                    before Madame Bouquet was arrested, together with the whole family of Guadet. It
                    was well known with what tenderness and ingenuity the father of that Deputy
                    sought to save his son, who, with his friend Salles, had taken refuge under his
                    roof. Carried before the Revolutionary Tribunal of Bourdeaux, his judges were
                    too prudent to question this venerable man concerning the concealment of his
                    son; even they dreaded the touching voice of nature, and the indignation of
                    virtue. He was simply asked why he had given asylum to Salles; to which the old
                    man answered by clasping his hands, and raising them to Heaven. Witness of this
                    afflicting scene, Madame Bouquet, as vehement in her indignation as she had been
                    impassioned in her protection of the Deputies, had not power to listen in
                    silence to such an interrogatory.

                "'Yes, monsters,' she cried, 'beasts of prey, fed with human blood! If humanity,
                    if family affections are crimes, we all merit death.' Throwing herself into the
                    arms of the elder Guadet, she burst into tears, adding, as she pressed the old
                    man to her bosom, 'we have now only to die.'

                "The Tribunal, perceiving the increasing interest in the spectators of this
                    affecting scene hastily closed the trial by pronouncing the fatal sentence of
                    death.
                "Thus fell this admirable woman, whose magnanimity does as much honour to human
                    nature, as her execution disgraces the system under which she died."

                "Another outlawed Deputy, Lanjuinais, took refuge at
                    Rennes, at a house belonging to his mother, and of which an old female domestic
                    had the care. The fear of terrifying this poor woman caused him, at first, to
                    conceal from her his real situation; but having learnt from the public papers
                    the execution of Guadet, at Bourdeaux, and that the government had extended
                    their inveterate proscriptions to those friends of the outlawed Deputies who
                    should give them shelter, and even to the domestics who would not reveal the
                    places of their concealment, he determined immediately to declare himself, and
                    prevail upon her to shun the impending danger by instantly quitting the house.

                    she, 'but it is a great deal to save the life of one’s master.'
                "In vain Lanjuinais remonstrated, entreated, and even commanded that she should
                    think of her own safety; it was enough, he assured her, that she kept the secret
                    of his asylum; while to remain near him, served but to endanger her own life,
                    without adding to the security of his. She rejected his reasons, and persisted
                    to demand, as a special favour, the privilege of remaining with him. She
                    prevailed, and through the zeal and exertions of this worthy domestic,
                    Lanjuinais finally escaped the researches of the government until the fall of

                    discovered the retreat of the unfortunate St. Etienne, and the benevolent Madame

                    Madame Ruvilly, whose compassionate heart was ever alive to the claims of
                    humanity. She did not consider her own danger, she did not even inquire who the
                    person was to whom she was about to give a shelter that might involve her in
                    utter ruin,—he was unfortunate, and Madame Ruvilly could not resist such a
                    title. She concealed him, and sought to lessen the sense of his misfortunes by
                    her kindness and attentions.

                "At the expiration of two days, the stranger came to take leave of her. Madame

                "'But where will you go?' said Madame Ruvilly. 'God will direct me,' answered the
                    stranger.—'What!' exclaimed Madame Ruvilly, 'know you not where to seek a
                    retreat, and would you have me expose you to such danger? Ah no! I cannot
                    consent to it. The more unprotected you are, the more it is my duty to shelter
                    you. I beseech you to remain 
                    60 HOSPITALITY. in this house, at least till a moment of less
                    danger.'

                "The old man resisted so strongly the humane entreaties of Madame Ruvilly, that
                    he came off victor in the generous contest; but though no one but a sister of
                    Madame Ruvilly witnessed the scene, the traces of such generous hospitality were
                    too soon detected. When summoned before the Revolutionary Tribunal, Madame
                    Ruvilly avowed the only service she had rendered to the old priest; her only
                    regret was the afflicting spectacle of her sister who was condemned to death,
                    for not having denounced her to the Tribunal.

                "These two women submitted to death with a pride of having incurred, from such a
                    government, the penalties attached to the performance of a generous action."
